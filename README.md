# Finding-CFR-using-Coronary_Flow_Reserve

Coronary flow reserve (CFR), defined as hyperemic or maximal coronary flow divided by resting flow is a physiologic index which interrogates the function of the entire coronary tree, both the larger epicardial coronary vessel and the microvasculature [1].

This repository contains a complete pipeline for predicting health status (Healthy vs Unhealthy) using various Machine Learning classifiers. It demonstrates:

✅ Data preprocessing (scaling + encoding)
✅ Training and evaluation of multiple models
✅ Calculation of key classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
✅ Visualization of:

ROC-AUC curves for all models

Learning curves for training & validation accuracy

Log loss curves for training & validation sets
✅ Confusion matrices for each model

📂 Project Structure
