# Using Clinical Risk Factors for either Classfication or Prediction of Coronary Flow Reserve

Coronary flow reserve (CFR), defined as hyperemic or maximal coronary flow divided by resting flow is a physiologic index which interrogates the function of the entire coronary tree, both the larger epicardial coronary vessel and the microvasculature [1]. The dataset used for this study 

This repository contains a complete pipeline for predicting health status (Healthy vs Unhealthy) using various Machine Learning classifiers. It demonstrates: Data preprocessing (scaling + encoding), Training and evaluation of multiple models, Calculation of key classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC) and Visualization of: ROC-AUC curves for all models and Learning curves for training & validation accuracy and Log loss curves for training & validation sets as well as the Confusion matrices for each model. 

# Rule for Classification
The routine described below has a simple rule described below. Note that this rule 
* CFR > 2.5 ‚Üí Healthy
* CFR ‚â§ 2.5 ‚Üí Unhealthy

üìÇ Project Structure 
* cfr_simulation_with_health_labels.csv ‚Äî Sample dataset (should be in your working directory)
* Prediction of Coronary Flow Reserve using Synthetic Data.py or notebook.ipynb ‚Äî Full Python script
* Classification of Patients using Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) values.py or notebook.ipynb ‚Äî Full Python script

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features - 
* Multiple Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, Naive Bayes.
* Explainability with SHAP: Uses TreeExplainer for trees (RF, GB, LGBM), Uses LinearExplainer for logistic regression and Global feature ranking + per-instance explanations. 
* LIME: Explains individual predictions and is Useful for local interpretability. 

‚öôÔ∏è Pipelines - 
* Uses Scikit-learn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer for clean, reproducible workflows.
* Label Encoding: Handles categorical health labels (Healthy / Unhealthy) robustly.
* Detailed Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC plus detailed classification_report.
* Visual Insights: ROC-AUC curves for comparing model performance and Learning & Loss curves for diagnosing under/overfitting.

NOTE: These results are to be submitted to the International Journal of Cardiology. 

# Issues and Limitation 
* Prdictions did not entirely work because while the evaluation metrices are printed after training and testing, the R square values are negative showing the models are not really learning enough. 
* While classifciation worked and printed beautiful accuracies and everything, the SHAP global feature importance plots showed that the risk factors did not fully contribute to the classification.
* The conclusion is that these clinical risk factors have no predictive power for CFR.

Next Steps
* Regenerate the synthetic datasets to have predictive power.
